## Achievements

The BIS Scraper project has been successfully transformed from its original implementation into a robust, well-tested, and well-documented Python package. The codebase now follows modern Python best practices, including:

1. Proper package structure with separation of concerns
2. Type hints throughout the codebase
3. Comprehensive error handling
4. Detailed documentation
5. Extensive test coverage
6. CI/CD integration

These improvements make the package more maintainable, extensible, and user-friendly, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements.
