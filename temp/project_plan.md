# BIS Scraper Project Plan

## Overview of Current State

The BIS Scraper is a Python package designed to download and process speeches from central banks via the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) website. The project has been successfully modernized from its original implementation to a well-structured Python package with enhanced features.

### Current Features

1. **Web Scraping**
   - Downloads central bank speeches from the BIS website
   - Processes metadata to identify the relevant institution
   - Handles URL queries with proper error handling
   - Uses in-memory caching to optimize performance

2. **PDF to Text Conversion**
   - Converts downloaded PDF speeches to text format
   - Maintains institution organization structure
   - Preserves original speech codes in filenames

3. **Data Organization**
   - Organizes files by institution in a clean directory structure
   - Uses consistent naming conventions (`YYMMDD[a-z].pdf/txt`)
   - Saves metadata in dedicated files per institution

4. **User Interface**
   - Command-line interface for all operations
   - Support for filtering by date range and institutions
   - Progress reporting and performance metrics

## Planned Features and Improvements

### High Priority

1. **Testing Framework**
   - Unit tests for core components
   - Integration tests for the full pipeline
   - Mocking of web requests for faster testing

2. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README with usage examples
   - API documentation for developers
   - Installation guide for different platforms

3. **Data Validation**
   - Verify PDF content before conversion
   - Handle corrupted or invalid files
   - Implement checksums for data integrity

### Medium Priority

1. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Parallel downloading of speeches
   - Async/await for network operations
   - Better throttling to respect server limits

2. **Analysis Tools**
   - Basic text analysis functions
   - Metadata extraction and statistics
   - Word frequency and topic modeling

3. **Data Export**
   - Export to common formats (CSV, JSON)
   - Integration with data analysis libraries
   - Support for structured data output

### Low Priority

1. **Web Interface**
   - Simple web dashboard for monitoring
   - Interactive query builder
   - Visualization of download progress

2. **Additional Sources**
   - Support for direct central bank websites
   - Alternative sources for speeches
   - Cross-referencing between sources

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Stabilization (Current)

- [x] Modernize codebase structure
- [x] Implement proper Python packaging
- [x] Add command-line interface
- [x] Optimize performance with caching
- [x] Ensure all original features are preserved
- [x] Update file naming and organization
- [x] Fix metadata filename inconsistency
- [x] Ensure consistent institution name normalization across all modules

### Phase 2: Testing and Documentation (Completed)

- [x] Write comprehensive tests for all modules
- [x] Set up continuous integration
- [x] Update README with detailed usage examples
- [x] Add development documentation
- [x] Add code quality checks
- [x] Create detailed API documentation

### Phase 3: Feature Extensions (Next)

- [ ] Add code quality CI checks (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Add API documentation generation
- [ ] Implement parallel processing
- [ ] Add text analysis capabilities
- [ ] Create data export functionalities
- [ ] Enhance error handling and recovery
- [ ] Implement resumable downloads

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

- [ ] Build web interface
- [ ] Add support for additional sources
- [ ] Implement more sophisticated analysis
- [ ] Create visualization components
- [ ] Support for data synchronization

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

1. **Network Resilience**
   - Need better handling of network timeouts
   - Implement backoff strategies for rate limiting

2. **Error Handling**
   - Create more specific exception types
   - Implement better recovery mechanisms

3. **Code Structure**
   - Consider further modularization of components
   - Reduce coupling between modules

## Conclusion

The BIS Scraper project has successfully transitioned from its original implementation to a modern, well-structured Python package. The current focus is on stabilizing the core functionality and ensuring all original features are preserved with improved implementation.

The next steps involve comprehensive testing, detailed documentation, and incremental feature additions to enhance the package's capabilities for central bank speech analysis.
