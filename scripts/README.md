## Running a Full Scraping Process

1. **Configure the scraping job**:
   ```bash
   nano scripts/run_full_scrape.sh
   ```
   
2. **Run the scraping process**:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./run_full_scrape.sh
   ```
   
   For long-running jobs, consider using screen or tmux:
   ```bash
   screen -S bis_scraper
   cd scripts
   ./run_full_scrape.sh
   # Detach with Ctrl+A followed by D
   # Reattach later with: screen -r bis_scraper
   ```

3. **Analyze the results**:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./analyze_results.sh
   ```
